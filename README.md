# About

This is a React Native project was built because I usually spend most of my time counting how many days are left for any dates.

# Example

Q: Today is 28th May, How many days are there before 13th June?

A: There are 16 days before 13th June! Normally, you would have to count the days using calendar and that is a hassle, so this app helps with that!

# Notes

This is just a side project, so there might be missing features such as missing icon and etc.
